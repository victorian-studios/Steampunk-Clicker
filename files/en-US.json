                "5": "Perfect! And, don't worry, I'll be quick.",
                "6": "First lets start with the places around the factory. First of all, we have the [b]Production Area[/b]!",

                "9" : "Remember: steam is the main resource off our society. With it, you can make most of the other materials. So prioritize it with upgrades and other expasions for a better performance in general.",
                "10" : "To produce anything, just [b]click[/b] in the icon and the machine will do the rest for you. For future machines, they'll also show the resources needed to start running. [b]Try it out![/b]",
                "10.1": "Perfect! It's simple. Now, let's continue...",
                "11" : "Next, we have the [b]Upgrade Area[/b]!",
                "12" : "Here you can check, buy and also unlock new upgrades for each producer you have.",
                "13" : "Later, try checking the tabs in the right, they'll show every producer's specific itens for making them even more efficient.",
                "14" : "And an important information: for unlocking new producers you just have to wait until their icon become available. Then you can check their price and finally start making new materials in the factory.",
                "15" : "Don't worry, I will come back again every time you have a new producer to unlock.",
                "16" : "Okay, now that's my favorite part: [b]The Workshop[/b]!",
                "17" : "In this place you can start using your materials for your main objective: making your armor and weapons.",
                "18" : "I'm not gonna lie to you, this monsters out there are pretty dangerous and also seam to be much stronger than we think. So you can't leave this place without finishing your armor completely.",
                "19" : "In the left part you have the [b]Weapons and Skills[/b] tabs. At the momment they're all locked by default. But it's just a matter of time until you have them all available to you.",
                "20" : "Each one have different uses and sometimes even an special effect for upgraded versions. Take your time to dedice wich one works better for every enemy. To equip is just drag and drop it in the available slot.",
                "21" : "Now the part you're waiting for: the [b]Armor[/b] tab in the right.",
                "22" : "As I said, you need to equip any type of armor to go out and fight the monstrers outside. I suggest start by a wooden version since it's simple, fast to make but not so effective.",
                "23" : "Just like the weapons/skills, you can also upgrade your armor for better stats and performance in battle. And can also come with a special bonus if you upgrade enough.",
                "24" : "To equip the armor, is just like the others, drag and drop it but in the slot in the middle.",
                "25" : "Perfect, now let's head back to the office.",
                "26" : "To finish, that's the office or, how I prefer say, the [b]Map Area[/b]!",
                "27" : "I've got an entire map of the city and the exterior part around it. Here you can see all the paths and decide where you want to go next.",
                "28" : "At the momment I can't see any other path to follow ratter than this one right here.",
                "29" : "But don't think too much, if you have an armor and a weapon, then you should try to check how strong these enemies are, their attack patterns, resistances and so on.", 
                "30" : "If you fail, just head back to the factory, upgrade and start over again.",
                "31" : "It's very probable that after defeating them, another one can come back again, so you can retry beating their faces another time. Just remember that you need to reach the root of the problem to solve all this.",
                "32" : "Well, I think that's all for now. Don't worry, as I said early, I'll come back again from time to time when there's something important to tell you.",
                "33" : "I love you Rose. Take care out there, It's dangerous to go alone. Make your armor and weapons to fight them!",
                "34" : "And most important: don't give up!"

                "3": "Anyway, would you mind if I help you recollect your battle skills?\n[color=rgb(255,255,255)]Press [b](Y)[/b] Yes / [b](N)[/b] No[/color]",

                "4": "First, when you enconter an enemy you can check their health above them. When it reaches [b]zero[/b], they will finally be defeated. Try to finish this as quickly as possible to avoid damaging the armor greatly.",
                "5": "Now you can choose wich ability you would like to use first. Check their information any time by moving your mouse over them.",
                "6": "Then click to select and finally click on your target to execute your move. After that you will finish your turn.",
                "7": "After you act, it's time for the enemies to attack you. Thankfully your armor was designed to receive an amount of damage and keep you alive. Just remember that you're not invincible.",
                "8": "Some enemies will have different attack patterns and, obviously, different abilities. You'll never know what they do until you fight them.",
                "9": "In case you suffer any damage, keep looking at the blue bar bellow. It's your main health bar, just like the enemies, when it reaches [b]zero[/b] you will be defeated.",
                "10": "But if you have paid attention, notece that there's also another small bar next to it. That ''batery'' represent's your shield power. That's what makes your armor special and versatile.",
                "11": "The energy remaining wont last forever, since it will absorb most of the damage received from the enemies during the fight. Unless the enemy has some penetrating attack that ignore the energy from the armor.",
                "12": "Remember: if you're loosing, it's better to retreat and come back to factory for further upgrades. Don't give up so easily! Try different builds and combinations. Every enemy has it's weakness!",
                "13": "That's all for now, good luck!"

                "2": "Oh okay okay. Sorry, lets be serious now. Well done! You've defeated the first threat in your path. But as you can imagine, there's many other enemies in the way.",
                "3": "Don't worry, things like that take time to resolve. You're in the right path. Now you've learned that most things needed to progress further and further.",
                "4": "But unfortunantly that's the [b]end of the demo![/b] Fell free to continue by retrying this last battle, producing materials and buying the rest of the remaining upgrades!",
